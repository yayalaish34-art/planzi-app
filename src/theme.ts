/**
 * The palette, unpacked into surfaces and marks: green, blue, yellow.
 *
 * `tint` is the pale card ground, `ink` the mark that sits on it. The slots
 * keep neutral names rather than colour names — every screen refers to them,
 * and a slot called `green` is a promise the next repaint has to keep.
 *
 * The inks are validated, not eyeballed. As a categorical set they clear all
 * six checks: the lightness band, the chroma floor, adjacent-pair CVD
 * separation (worst pair ΔE 13.6 protan), the normal-vision floor, and 3:1
 * against the page.
 *
 * Two things that validation forced, and which are easy to undo by accident:
 *
 * The yellow is an amber (#B8860B), not the butter yellow it looks like it
 * should be. Anything lighter cannot reach 3:1 on a near-white page — the
 * previous butter yellow sat at 2.59:1 — so a lighter one would be a mark
 * some people simply cannot see. The *tint* is still buttery; only the ink
 * that has to be read is deepened.
 *
 * The green and the yellow are neighbours in hue, which is the pair red-blind
 * vision merges. They are separated by lightness rather than by hue, which is
 * why the green is this dark. Nudging either toward the other collapses them:
 * the palette this replaced sat at ΔE 5.8 for a protanope, well under the 8
 * floor, and two of its rows were genuinely indistinguishable.
 *
 * One rule survives from before: `yellow.ink` is never a status mark. Against
 * `colors.danger` it drops to ΔE 4.7 for a deuteranope, so a yellow
 * "scheduled" dot and a red "overdue" dot would be the same dot. Yellow
 * dresses surfaces; the status vocabulary is green, blue, muted grey and red.
